					<div class="content">
						<p>This Privacy Policy & Cookies Notice (“Notice”) describes how Bragg Live Food Products, LLC
							(hereinafter “Bragg”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) collects, uses, and discloses information about you
							when you access or use any portion of our website and the information and services made available
							to you when you visit our website (the “Site”). The types of information we collect depend on how
							you use our Site. We may update this Notice at any time, and we will indicate at the top of this
							page the date it was last revised. If you have any questions about this Notice, please do not
							hesitate to contact us at privacy@bragg.com</p>

						<p>Types of Information Collected by Bragg</p>

						<p>The most common information we collect is the information you provide us. For instance, when you
						create an account with us or contact us through the online portal provided on our Site to ask
						questions or subscribe to our newsletter, we ask you to provide certain personal information, such as
						your name, company, email address, location, and other contact details. If you contact us by phone,
						email, social media, or by some other means, we may keep a record of that correspondence and any
						information that you submitted in connection therewith. When we send you emails, including
						newsletters, we may also track if you open them. We may also collect other content and information you
						share by commenting on or participating in online forums and similar social media communities, or when
						you otherwise interact with us by any other means. If you want to purchase our products from the Site,
						it is our policy to redirect you to a third-party merchant. The Site may ask you to enter information
						about your location in order to direct you to the retailer nearest to you. Or the Site may direct you
						to a third-party online retailer. Please refer to those third-parties’ privacy policies and terms of
						use to learn more about their privacy practices, which we do not control. You may also purchase our
						products over the phone with one of Bragg’s customer service representatives. The phone representative
						may request certain personal information in order to complete the transaction, such as your name,
						company, email address, shipping address, phone number and other contact details. They may also
						request payment information, such as your credit or debit card number or your bank account number in
						order to process payments from you or to remit payments to you in connection with your purchase. When
						you make a purchase or return, we collect information about the transaction, such as product details,
						purchase price, and date and location of the transaction.</p>

						<p>We (and our service providers) may collect information about how you use and interact with the Site
						using various technologies, such as cookies or web beacons. A cookie is a small text file that any
						website, including ours, places in your internet browser to save your preferences. We may use cookies
						to collect information about your location, your browser, when you accessed the Site and for how long,
						the website address that linked you to our Site, and the website you visited after leaving our Site.
						We may also use cookies to share information with other websites, media partners and social networks
						in order to offer you pertinent promotional and adverting communications that match your interests
						(third party cookies). Most browsers allow you to block and delete cookies. You may disable the
						installation of cookies by configuring your browser appropriately. However, if you do that, please be
						aware that the Site may not work properly. If you do not wish Bragg to use all or part of the
						above-mentioned cookies, please contact us at privacy@bragg.com. We may also utilize web analytics to
						help us improve our Site and increase website traffic. For example, we may use Google Analytics or
						other similar service providers to track and analyze our website data such as how many visitors we are
						getting, how long they stayed on the Site, their browsing habits, and their geographical location.
						Examining data from web analytics helps us understand who typically visits our Site, how they get to
						our Site, and what parts of are Site are viewed or visited most often. Understanding our audience
						helps us improve the products and services we provide to our customers.</p>

						<p>When and Why Bragg May Use Your Information</p>

						<p>We use your information for a variety of business and commercial purposes, such as for the purpose of:
						processing or fulfilling orders and transactions; providing customer service; marketing and
						advertising; internal research; providing, maintaining and improving our products and services;
						understanding our audience and improving the Site; communicating with you about our products;
						analyzing trends and usage of our Site; investigating and preventing fraud or other illegal
						activities, including any violation of our Terms of Use; maintaining appropriate records for internal
						administrative and accounting purposes; and for any other purpose communicated to you at the time the
						information was collected or as permitted by law.</p>

						<p>When and Why Bragg May Share your Information with Others</p>

						<p>We may share your information with other companies, third-party merchants, vendors, consultants and
						other service providers to assist us with the overall operation of our company. Our business
						operations rely on many third-party vendors that offer a variety of helpful services such as:
						marketing and advertising, logistics; order fulfillment; shipping; web hosting; ecommerce and online
						selling platforms; internet infrastructures; cloud computing; payment collection and processing; site
						analytics and optimization; inbound and outbound email services; spam filtering; social networking;
						and both direct and computer-mediated services that facilitate the creation or sharing of information,
						ideas, interests and other forms of expression related to the promotion and sale of our products.
						Please refer to these third-parties’ privacy policies and terms of use to learn more about their
						privacy practices, which we do not control. We cannot control or be held responsible for third
						parties’ privacy practices. There is also a chance we may share your personal information with others
						in order to: comply with government regulations, respond to court orders, comply with subpoenas or
						warrants, or adhere to other legal requirements; facilitate internal audits, company valuation or
						related internal due diligence; assist with the negotiation of or actual change of control or
						ownership in the company due to investment, merger, sale of company assets, financing or acquisition;
						and to personalize advertisements or connect you with merchants we believe you may be interested in
						and vice versa.</p>

						<p>Data security.</p>
					
						<p>We protect your personal data with various technical and organizational security measures that aim to
							minimize risks associated with data loss and the unauthorized use, disclosure and alteration of data.
							To this end, we use technology like firewalls and data encryption. We also restrict access to data
							with authorization controls for data access. Additionally, you should take all steps necessary to
							maintain the privacy of your accounts and related log-in and password information as well as restrict
							access by others to your computer devices. Our privacy and security features have limits. If you
							suspect that someone other than you has accessed your account, email, or otherwise acted in a
							fraudulent way insofar as it concerns your relationship with Bragg, please notify us immediately.</p>
						<p>Your Choices</p>
						<p>Many web browsers accept cookies by default. You have the choice to remove or reject browser cookies.
							Please note that if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this could affect your use of and the
							functionality of our Site. Further, we only want to communicate with those who want to hear from us.
							You have the right to unsubscribe from our emails and newsletters at any time by simply clicking the
							designated “unsubscribe” link. If you would like to delete, update or correct your email address,
							mailing address, phone number or other contact information you provided us, please contact us at
							privacy@bragg.com. Requests to remove or update your contact information may take up to fifteen
							business days.</p>
						<p>Storage of Data</p>
						<p>We may store data until it is no longer necessary. This determination is made on a case-by-case basis
							and depends on the nature of the data. For example, it may be necessary to store personal data
							regarding pending or future legal disputes, or for things like maintaining and improving our Site and
							our products, or for keeping our systems secure, or for maintaining appropriate business and financial
							records. Personal data contained in contracts, documents, notifications and other business
							correspondence may also be subject to statutory storage obligations depending on the law in the
							applicable region.</p>
						<p>Links to Third Party Websites</p>
						<p>Our Site may contain links to websites operated and maintained by third parties, over which we have no
							control, including social media websites hosted by third-party providers. However, this Privacy Notice
							only addresses Bragg’s collection and use of your information, if any. Your access to such third-party
							websites is solely at your own risk. You should read the privacy policy and terms and conditions of
							any other website before using and disclosing any of your information on such website.</p>
						<p>The Global Distribution of our Products</p>
						<p>We have authorized distributors located outside of the United States. Your information may be
							transferred, transmitted to, stored, or processed in the United States or other areas located outside
							your country as necessary for us to provide our Products to consumers throughout the world. We may
							utilize third-party platforms, domains, and other third-party service providers located outside your
							country to assist us in the global promotion, sale and distribution of our products. We carefully
							select business partners that have effective security measures and safeguards in place, however you
							should consult their terms of use and privacy policies, which we have no control over, to determine
							how they collect and use data. Because some recipients of your personal data are located outside your
							country, please note that protection laws may provide a different level of protection than the laws in
							your country.</p>
						<p>Your Privacy Rights</p>
						<p>In those countries where we are required to do so by law, you may have the right to be informed as to
							how and whether your personal data is being collected and obtain a copy thereof, and in some cases,
							you may have the right to request erasure of your personal data. For further questions about your
							privacy rights, please contact privacy@bragg.com. Finally, you may have the right to lodge a complaint
							with a supervisory authority of the national or regional privacy laws applicable to you.</p>
						<p>Data Protection Officer</p>
						<p>In those countries where we are required to do so by law, we have appointed a Data Protection Officer
							to oversee the processing and protection of your personal data. Our Data Protection Officer can be
							contacted by email at privacy@bragg.com or through physical mail to the attention of the Data
							Protection Officer for Bragg Live Food Products, LLC, Box 7, Santa Barbara, California, USA, 93102.</p>

						that we delete certain pieces of their personal information, excluding aggregated non-identifiable
						information that we collect to improve our services. You may submit a written request to
						privacy@bragg.com. After you (or an agent which you authorize) submit a request to access or delete
						your personal information, we are required to “verify” that your request is not fraudulent. Thus, upon
						receiving your request, we may use various verification methods to verify the request as the
						circumstances dictate.</p>

						<p>We reserve the right to deny your deletion request if we determine that retaining the information is
						necessary for us or our service provider(s) to: attend to pending or future legal disputes; keep our
						websites and systems secure and identify and repair errors that impair site functionality; maintain
						appropriate business and financial records; complete the transaction for which we collected the
